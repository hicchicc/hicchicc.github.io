x0y0pxFreeFont is a website that distributes pixel fonts created by hicc.

The fonts are capable of pixel-by-pixel display, making them particularly popular in pixel art game development and translation.

Currently, the fonts are licensed under a proprietary license, but in 2026 they will be gradually transitioned to the SIL license, making them even easier to use.
